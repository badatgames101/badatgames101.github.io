                <p class="aboutmetxt">
                    I enjoy tinkering around inside of Unreal Engine & creating small projects, 
                    used in part to test the limits of gameplay mechanics. 
                    I also have a searing passion for all things related to technology, whether it be software or hardware 
                    - currently, I've grown accustom specifically to Virtual Reality. 
                    I have an eagerness for learning a vast variety of skills & programming languages, 
                    mainly HTML, CSS & C++ (Java Script is also an option, although not one that is a priority at the moment). 
                    I am currently enrolled in a Level 3 BTEC Games Technology course with 
                    3 years of PhotosShop experience & 2 years of experience inside of Maya and Unreal Engine. In regards to a career path, 
                    I see myself as either a gameplay programmer or a generalist programmer within Unreal Engine.

                            This was one of the first projects that i was genuainly intersted in. 
                            <p class="imagedescriptiontext" > <br>
                                this porject was an amazing learning experiance for me and this not so simple project of making 
                                two portals helped me to realise that i loved created mechanics for games instead of the entire game itself

        <span class="img2desc">
            <p class="imagedescriptiontext">
                This was another project that i started in my own time to try and combine different animations.
                <p class="imagedescriptiontext" > <br>
                    this porject was used more as a way for me to 
                    figure out my strengths and weaknesses withing unreal engine 4.27 and a way for me to solidify what i 
                    currently know into something that i can expand on later.
